## Statistical Models for Economic Growth Rate Analysis
**Description:**
This project aims to investigate the relationship between economic indicators and GDP growth rate. We analyze various factors such as inflation rate, unemployment rate, real interest rate, primary school enrollment rate, and their impact on GDP growth. Using multivariate linear regression models, we aim to identify the most influential factors affecting economic growth across different time periods and countries.â€¨

**Team Size:** 4

**Project Workflow:**
* Data Preprocessing:
  * Clean and preprocess the data to handle missing values, outliers, and ensure consistency.
  * Normalize or standardize numerical features if necessary.
* Model Training:
  * Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
  * Train each model using the training set.
* Model Evaluation:
  * Evaluate the performance of each model using metrics like R-squared, RMSE, and MAE.** 
  * Compare the models to identify the most influential factors affecting GDP growth rate.
* Interpretation & Reporting:
  * Interpret the coefficients of the regression models to understand the impact of each variable on GDP growth rate.
  * Present the findings through visualizations and a comprehensive report.
